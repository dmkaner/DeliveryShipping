App I created as a delivery service kind of like Uber. Made with React Native, very stable and maticulous build. 
Uses many technologies that in conjunciton are hard to get working perfectly but here lies an implementation 
that, with a lot of time put in, got things working nicely. Implements:

Firebase Firestore as a database
Firebase Cloud Functions for interactions with Stripe
Stripe for processing payments
Google Maps API and its constituents

Although this does not seem like a lot, at the time it is pretty hard to get all of these working considering these
are not really made for React Native but more-so JavaScript. If nothing else this app serves as a very useful boilerplate
to creating a React Native app that needs to process payments, use google maps, and have a database. 

To get running on your own machine, simply clone the enviornment and run "npm run ios" or "npm run android"
